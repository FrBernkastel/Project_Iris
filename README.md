# Project_Iris

## Introduction
Project Iris is set for Mia to build a personal website and draft the her first Project - Education data analysis. The whole project includes two parts. The first part is for Education data analysis. We are going to dig into the education data and analyze the trend of Chinese education development and provide the insight about it. The second part is for setting up a personal blog with tool *Hexo*. We will create our own theme, which is called Iris.

By the way, the Project is named as Iris - my favorite flower on this planet.
